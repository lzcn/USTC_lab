Hello! This is Ruiyuan Song. I am a Ph.D. student at the School of Cyberspace Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), Hefei, China. I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yan Chen](https://chenyanustc.github.io/) and Prof. Qibin Sun. My research interest lies in multimodal machine learning, unsupervised learning and wireless sensing.
