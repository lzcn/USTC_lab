Hello! This is Rui Zhang (张锐). I am a Ph.D. student at the School of Cyber Science and Engineering, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC). I received B.S. degree from the Hefei University of Technology (HFUT) in 2020.

I am supervised by [Prof. Yan Chen](https://chenyanustc.github.io/). My current research interests include Wireless Sensing, Deep Learning, and Computer Vision.
