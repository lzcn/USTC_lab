Hello! This is Jinduo Wang (王金舵). I am a Ph.D. student at the School of Cyberspace Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC). I received B.S. degree from the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China, in 2019.

I am supervised by [Prof. Yan Chen](https://ustc-ip-lab.github.io/author/yan-chen/). My current research interest lies in Wireless Sensing, Digital Health, and Deep Learning.
