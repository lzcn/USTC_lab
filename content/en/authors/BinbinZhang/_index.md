Hello, This is Bin-Bin Zhang(张宾宾).Welcome to my homepage! I am currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree at the School of Cyberspace Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China(USTC), Hefei, China. I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yan Chen](https://chenyanustc.github.io/). My current research interests include wireless sensing, deep learning and domain adaptation.
