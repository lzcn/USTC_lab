In-home human monitoring systems, which could continuously monitor user information such as location and vital sign, have been attractive to provide assistance for personal healthcare, i.e., to provide healthcare professionals with rich information to understand the health conditions of users. For instance, the location information is able to answer the question like “does the person spend too much time somewhere in home?” or “do the couple stay close with each other?” while the vital sign information can be utilized to detect unusual breath and heartbeat, which provides valuable information for medical diagnoses. In this project, we propose a human sensing system with radio signals, MTrack, for in-home healthcare, which is capable of tracking the trajectories of moving persons and vital signs of static persons under the multi-person scenarios.
