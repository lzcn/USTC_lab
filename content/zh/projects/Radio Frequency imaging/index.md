Radio frequency (RF) imaging technologies aiming to recover shapes of 3-Dimensional objects enable various applications such as smart home, security inspection, and autonomous vehicles. These technologies benefit from the nature of wireless signals, i.e., the wireless signals can work in all-weather and all-day conditions while preventing privacy leakage. However, the existing systems fail to provide fine-grained imaging results, e.g., the result is often composed of several blobs at different positions or the entire object is represented as a single point. In this project, we propose to perform imaging with a large 2D antenna array and wide-band signals.
